  <p>
    i'm a simple guy with simple needs - 2 wheels, spotify premium, my fender
    stratocaster ðŸŽ¸ and a bucket of side projects somewhere around 80% done. i
    enjoy traveling, pretending I know how to cook, and writing code. i'm a
    versatile, full-stack developer with experience in flutter/dart (for mobile
    dev), java, c++, c# (oop languages) and of course a deep and (sometimes)
    fulfilling relationship with javascript. react, next, express, nest, and
    most recently svelte
